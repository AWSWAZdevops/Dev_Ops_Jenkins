I would like to submit my personal statement expressing my interest for the role of Compliance Analyst. Here are my strengths and current skills which I believe will make me the right candidate for the role.

In my Current role within the PNC bureau my intelligence work has consisted of ensuring quality of all arrest summons reports, and creates them manually where necessary for the force within time constraints.

I have also had to Identify inconsistencies between custody records and PNC with regard to and resolve the issues accordingly

Identify custody records where warning signals (words that warn of a particular behaviour or medical issue which police should be aware) have been placed by custody officers, or should have been placed, and were not, and add them to PNC

Another responsibility of mine is to update all information on PNC including vehicle reports, ad hoc intelligence and creating and sending PNC Broadcast messages as required whilst providing a reliable and timely service to external and internal stakeholders including capturing and escalating PNC access issues, resetting PNC passwords 

My Previous role as a Senior Agent required me to be the first point of contact for all telephone and email enquiries for the City Of London Corporation and with the type of queries that I dealt with involved a great deal of problem solving. I am confident when dealing with customers, members, Councillors, police staff and internal stakeholders and feel that I provide excellent customer service to customers. Within a year I expanded my knowledge and gained a lot of experience of working within the Council which pursued be to apply for a senior agent role whilst maintaining high service levels by being both accurate and delivering good quality information to customers and Internal services within the Council.

I would like to highlight in bullet points my skills and experience and how I have always shown a positive attitude, have been a team player, gone the extra mile, and the ability to work well within and across teams

• Conducting Checks on Mitel Intelligence system and analysing Intelligence gathered from calls taken / received and providing reports and findings to managers/stake holders

• Being a flexible positive team player to fit the Council's needs and requirements such as shift swapping, being flexible and helping the team in someone’s absence, and alerting my Team Leader if there is any cover which needs to be arranged in my absence so that they can plan accordingly

• Throughout my years of working within the Council I have also built many relationships by liaising with other departments such as Traffic Management, Community Services, Planning, and, Environmental Services. I believe this does play a key factor when being consistent in maintaining a high service level and working within teams 

• I have a built a good rapport with colleagues from other departments, which have allowed me to proactively prioritise, plan and schedule complex tasks
